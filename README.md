# Super Scaler

Storing high-resolution images is a challenging problem due to its high storage cost and growing storage demands. To address this issue, we explore the feasibility of using deep convolutional networks for efficient storage and on- demand high resolution image generation.

In this project, we conducted experiments using Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) and Efficient Sub-Pixel Neural Network (ESPCN) to generate high resolution images given low resolution images as the inputs. We evaluated the performance of SRCNN and ESPCN with a scaling factor of 4x. Our results show that SRCNN and ESPCN can produce promising results in producing high-resolution images with improved quality compared to traditional upscaling methods such as bicubic interpolation. However, we should carefully considered the trade-off between image quality and computational cost as SRCNN and ESPCN can be computationally intensive for both training and real-time inference.
